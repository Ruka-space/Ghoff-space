        <p>We aim to be one of the leading organizations in student exchange and to expand our projects in beach protection and environmental conservation. The foundation of Safrni is about building a family, not just organizing trips. We don't just offer vacations; we create memories.</p>

        <p>The story began in 2017 when I was just a member in one of the organizations and realized that the focus wasn't on the journey or the client, but rather seeing it as a mere product. That's when I decided to make a change. In June 2020, I found myself with a group of people from all over the world, each with a different language and culture. It was then that I realized I was not just adding value to their lives but also learning from them. We were all changing each other's lives.</p>

        <p>It was from this moment that I started to see myself as a representative of my country, my environment, and my home. I wanted to show the world Egypt from a different perspective. Over time, our team grew, and we started to develop further, creating more useful and impactful work. We expanded beyond Egypt and reached many other countries.</p>

        <p>Safrni started with an idea, and that idea evolved into a company. The company grew into a family. Our mission continues to grow with us, creating more memories and meaningful connections.</p>
